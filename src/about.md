I am a designer, maker and public servant living on the former estate of a Huguenot family in Camberwell<sup>1</sup>, South London. 

You can find a selection of my work and personal projects here, including pieces of furniture, websites, posters, paintings, sculpture, fashion, hand-bound books and architectural design. 

At the moment, I am studying for a MSc in Political Sociology at the London School of Economics.

I'm open to all sorts of new projects and enquiries. If you like to talk about commissions and collaborations, you can email me here: eorlik@gmail.com.

You can download my CV <a href="/assets/edward-orlik-cv-2022.pdf">here</a>.
